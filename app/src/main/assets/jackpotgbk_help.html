        <h1>About Jackpot GBK</h1>
        <p>
            Jackpot GBK (<i>Gunting, Batu, Kertas</i>) is an unique twist to the original "Rock,
            Paper, Scissors" game (also known as "Roshambo"). Regular "Rock, Paper, Scissors" rules
            apply, but with additional constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, <b>you cannot simply choose &#x1F5FF; Rock, &#x1F4C3; Paper, or &#x2702;&#xFE0F;
            Scissors.</b> In order to choose, you must match at least two out of 3 icons (using the
            <b>Start/Stop</b> button).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>&#x1F5FF;&#x1F5FF;&#x1F5FF;: Allowed (Awarded &#x1F5FF; twice)</li>
            <li>&#x1F4C3;&#x2702;&#xFE0F;&#x1F4C3;: Allowed (Awarded &#x1F4C3;)</li>
            <li>&#x1F5FF;&#x1F4C3;&#x2702;&#xFE0F;: Forfeit (Awarded &#x274C;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you are able to match three, the matched item will be
            matched to your opponent twice. Unfortunately, if you are unable to match, you will be
            given a <b>&#x274C; Forfeit</b> which will increase the opponent's score, unless if the
            opponent does the same.

            This game is based on the original Jackpot GBK game

            which was written in JavaScript. The Android version of this game does not include
            multiplayer (more than 2 players) support, and mostly rewritten in Java from scratch.
